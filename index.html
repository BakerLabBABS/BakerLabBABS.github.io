                    <p>We study complex systems and their origins, working among microbiology, biophysics, synthetic biology and evolutionary biology. Roughly half of us work, at the moment, on the bacterial flagellar motor. We use this as a model molecular complex to explore protein engineering, directed and experimental evolution, and to understand better how bacterial swimming has evolved and how we can push it to do new things.</p>
<p>Roughly the other half of us work on &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; synthetic biology where we try to use insights gleaned from understanding an ancient molecular complex (the motor) to build new nanotechnologies out of simple lipid and DNA components to see how we can increase the complexity step-by-step to create new tools in biosensing and light-activation.</p>
<p>We welcome applications to join our group and have spaces for PhD applicants and postdocs where suitable. Please contact <a href="https://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/matthew-baker">Matt</a> if you are interested in joining or collaborating.</p>

<p>Matt finished an Hons in <a href="https://chemistry.anu.edu.au/">Chemistry</a> at ANU studying Fluctuation Theorems before completing his DPhil in <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/">Physics</a> at Oxford University looking at the molecular motor that makes many bacteria swim. There he first learned to love microbiology where you could work with complex living systems but also put them &lsquo;on ice&rsquo; when you needed to.  Matt started this group at the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Science (<a href="https://www.babs.unsw.edu.au">BABS</a>) in 2018 as a <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/scientia-program">Scientia Fellow</a>.

<h5 id="pietro-ridone">Pietro Ridone</h5>
<p><img src="images/Pietro.jpg" alt="PietroHead"></p>
<p>Pietro joined the lab in July 2019 for his first Postdoc and has since been applying genome editing and synthetic biology techniques to study the stator proteins powering the rotation of bacterial flagella. Born and bred in Florence, Italy, has been fascinated by synthetic biology since the early days of his bachelor years at the University of Glasgow (Scotland, 2008-2012) where he also joined the Glasgow iGEM team for the 2011 edition of the competition. He studied the biophysics of bacterial and human mechanosensitive channels (MscS, MscL and Piezo1) during his PhD in the lab of Prof. Boris Martinac (VCCRI, Sydney), before returning to synbio at the Baker lab. He is currently focusing on engineering the E.coli genome using CRISPR and designing artificial stators to study the evolvability of the bacterial flagellar system. When away from lab duties he can be found roaming around campus in search of strong coffees or defending a goal on the football pitches of Moore park.</p>

<p>Alex is our resident chemistry guru, having completed his PhD in Chemistry in 2017 at UNSW Sydney, where he was focused on building an artificial mitochondria by combining polymer vesicles with purified proteins from the electron transport chain. For his first postdoc, he moved overseas to the van Hest group at the Eindhoven University of Technology (the Netherlands), to develop artificial cells made from liquid-liquid phase separated materials. He moved back to Sydney in 2021, where he is now investigating the biophysics of DNA-based functional objects (such as pores) in planar lipid membranes, with the ultimate aim to build networks of light-addressable droplets capable of signal transduction. In his spare time, Alex loves to cook, grow vegetables, go scuba diving, and hang out with his dog Rusty.</p>

                    <p>We have the following research projects currently active in the lab and open for motivated prospective PhD students to join.

<h4 id="project-1-the-origins-of-motility">Project 1: The Origins of Motility.</h4>
<p>The evolutionary origins of the bacterial flagellum have been a subject of scientific and public controversy – how can evolution produce such a complex system? We believe we can make progress on the issue by updating old phylogenetic work with new datasets and improved models, and combining this with experimental evolution work being done in our labs. The project is to assemble a well-organized database of flagellar proteins and explore sequenced bacterial genomes with genome browsers and sequence-similarity searches.</p>
<h4 id="project-2-ancestral-reconstruction-of-the-bacterial-flagellar-motor">Project 2: Ancestral Reconstruction of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor</h4>
<p><img src="images/dinoplate.jpg#floatright" alt="dinoplate">
We recreate microbial ‘Jurassic Parks’ by resurrecting ancient flagellar motor componentry in contemporary	hosts and measuring how well they work to let bacteria swim. This allows us to create ancient motors that have never existed in the present day to synthesise and evolve new motors as well as to learn about the process of evolution.</p>
<h4 id="project-3-evolution-across-interfaces">Project 3: Evolution Across Interfaces</h4>
<p>We aim to explore how motility evolves across interfaces, when a bacterium faces a change in environment and how  bacteria adapt to dwindling nutrient across such an interface. This project has scope for designing and building custom tanks to optimise bacterial evolution using 3D printing and prototyping, as well as investigating microbiology and bacterial motility in multiple dimensions using layered swim devices.</p>
<h4 id="project-4-driving-fluidic-flows-with-the-bacterial-flagellar-motor">Project 4: Driving Fluidic Flows with the Bacterial Flagellar Motor</h4>
<p>We utilise the high efficiency and self assembly of the flagellar motor to drive rotation of cells on patterned surfaces to control mixing and fluid flows in microfluidics. This project suits someone with aninterest in DIY/maker culture and the fabrication of fluidic devices to manipulate and respond to flows.</p>
<h4 id="project-5-developing-dna-lipid-nanotechnology">Project 5: Developing DNA-lipid nanotechnology</h4>
<p><img src="images/droplet.jpg#floatright" alt="droplet">
We design DNA origami nanostructures that can bind and release from liposomes to direct the fusion of liposomes. We hope to apply this to trigger liposome fusion on demand using light and electrical signals. This project involves in vitro synthetic biology, DNA and lipid nanotechnologies and microscopy.</p>
