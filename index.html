                    <p>We are a research group in the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Science (<a href="https://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/">BABS</a>). We combine bottom-up <em>in vitro</em> synbio from purified proteins, lipids and DNA, with top-down genome editing of microbes. Overall, we apply biophysical methods in synthetic biology and experimental evolution to understand the origins of complex systems.</p>

                    <p>We study complex systems and their origins, working among microbiology, biophysics, synthetic biology and evolutionary biology. Roughly half of us work, at the moment, on the bacterial flagellar motor. We use this as a model molecular complex to explore protein engineering, directed and experimental evolution, and to understand better how bacterial swimming has evolved and how we can push it to do new things.</p>
<p>Roughly the other half of us work on &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; synthetic biology where we try to use insights gleaned from understanding an ancient molecular complex (the motor) to build new nanotechnologies out of simple lipid and DNA components to see how we can increase the complexity step-by-step to create new tools in biosensing and light-activation.</p>
<p>We welcome applications to join our group and have spaces for PhD applicants and postdocs where suitable. Please contact <a href="https://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/matthew-baker">Matt</a> if you are interested in joining or collaborating.</p>

<p>Matt finished an Hons in <a href="https://chemistry.anu.edu.au/">Chemistry</a> at ANU studying Fluctuation Theorems before completing his DPhil in <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/">Physics</a> at the University of Oxford looking at the molecular motor that makes many bacteria swim. There he first learned to love microbiology where you could work with complex living systems but also put them &lsquo;on ice&rsquo; when you needed to.  Matt started this group at the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Science (<a href="https://www.babs.unsw.edu.au">BABS</a>) in 2018 as a <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/scientia-program">Scientia Fellow</a>. Matt was promoted to Scientia Senior Lecturer in 2019 and to Scientia Associate Professor in 2023. Matt is currently in Athens and Heraklion Greece as a Visiting Professor at the <a href="https://www.imbb.forth.gr/en/">IMBB-FoRTH</a> and the <a href="http://en.biol.uoa.gr/">University of Athens</a>.

<p><img src="images/Pietro.jpg" alt="PietroHead"></p>
<p>Pietro joined the lab in July 2019 for his first Postdoc and has since been applying genome editing and synthetic biology techniques to study the stator proteins powering the rotation of bacterial flagella. Born and bred in Florence, Italy, has been fascinated by synthetic biology since the early days of his bachelor years at the University of Glasgow (Scotland, 2008-2012) where he also joined the Glasgow iGEM team for the 2011 edition of the competition. He studied the biophysics of bacterial and human mechanosensitive channels (MscS, MscL and Piezo1) during his PhD in the lab of Prof. Boris Martinac (VCCRI, Sydney), before returning to synbio at the Baker lab. He is currently focusing on engineering the E.coli genome using CRISPR and designing artificial stators to study the evolvability of the bacterial flagellar system. When away from lab duties he can be found roaming around campus in search of strong coffees or defending a goal on the football pitches of Moore park.</p>

                    <p>We have the following research projects currently active in the lab and open for motivated prospective PhD students to join. Those interested in applying should consider the <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/key-dates">key dates</a> and <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/how-apply">application process</a>.</p>
<h4 id="project-area-1-ancestral-reconstruction-of-the-bacterial-flagellar-motor">Project Area 1: Ancestral Reconstruction of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor</h4>
<p><img src="images/dinoplate.jpg#floatright" alt="dinoplate">
We recreate microbial ‘Jurassic Parks’ by resurrecting ancient flagellar motor componentry in contemporary hosts and measuring how well they work to let bacteria swim. This allows us to create ancient motors that have never existed in the present day to synthesise and evolve new motors as well as to learn about the process of evolution. We focus in particular on the proteins that make up the stator complex (the engine) and the filament (the propellor).</p>
<h4 id="project-area-2-the-origins-of-motility">Project Area 2: The Origins of Motility.</h4>
<p><img src="images/motbphylo.jpg#floatright" alt="phylo">
The evolutionary origins of the bacterial flagellum have been a subject of scientific and public controversy – how can evolution produce such a complex system? We make progress on the issue by updating old phylogenetic work with new datasets and improved models and combining this with experimental evolution work being done in our lab. The project is to assemble a well-organized database of flagellar proteins and explore sequenced bacterial genomes with genome browsers and sequence-similarity searches.</p>
<h4 id="project-area-3-evolution-across-interfaces">Project Area 3: Evolution Across Interfaces</h4>
<p>We aim to explore how motility evolves across interfaces, when a bacterium faces a change in environment and how  bacteria adapt to dwindling nutrient across such an interface. This project has scope for designing and building custom tanks to optimise bacterial evolution using 3D printing and prototyping, as well as investigating microbiology and bacterial motility in multiple dimensions using layered swim devices.</p>
<h4 id="project-area-4-driving-fluidic-flows-with-the-bacterial-flagellar-motor">Project Area 4: Driving Fluidic Flows with the Bacterial Flagellar Motor</h4>
<p><img src="images/fluidics.png#floatright" alt="fluidics">
We utilise the high efficiency and self assembly of the flagellar motor to drive rotation of cells on patterned surfaces to control mixing and fluid flows in microfluidics. This project suits someone with an interest in DIY/maker culture and the fabrication of fluidic devices to manipulate and respond to flows. We engineer bacteria to drive rotation only when illuminated by different wavelengths of light and then incorporate external light-based control of flagellar motors to drive microfluidic flows.</p>
<h4 id="project-area-5-developing-dna-lipid-nanotechnology">Project Area 5: Developing DNA-lipid nanotechnology</h4>
<p><img src="images/droplet.jpg#floatright" alt="droplet">
We design DNA origami nanostructures that can bind and release from liposomes to direct the fusion of liposomes. We hope to apply this to trigger liposome fusion on demand using light and electrical signals. This project involves in vitro synthetic biology, DNA and lipid nanotechnologies and microscopy, and has potential for students interested in learning how to build custom high resolution microscopes.</p>
<h4 id="project-area-6-signalling-across-membranes">Project Area 6: Signalling across membranes</h4>
<p>We use droplet interface bilayers and droplet hydrogel bilayers to create custom membranes of any composition and then a combination of in vitro protein and DNA nanotechnology to add complexity to these systems one component at a time. We aim to make the biological equivalent of the transistor - leveraging logic gates and computational power of DNA nanotechnology with varied protein functions in our synthetic droplet systems.</p>
<h4 id="project-area-7-machine-learning-applications-to-melanoma-diagnosis">Project Area 7: Machine learning applications to melanoma diagnosis</h4>
<p><img src="images/ML.png#floatright" alt="ML">
We use machine learning frameworks to classify melanoma images from <em>in vivo</em> and <em>ex vivo</em> confocal microscopy in partnership with our clinician collaborators and <a href="http://vafaeelab.com/">A/Prof Fatemeh Vafaee</a>. In our lab we use our knowledge of microscopy and image analysis to optimise data flows for machine learning to then diagnose cancers and detect melanoma boundaries in tissue.</p>
